# TweetCollector

A simple node.js application that allows a user to collect tweets from Twitter's search API, and write them to a MongoDB collection.

This code was forked from Smart Chicago's [TweetCollector](https://github.com/smartchicago/TweetCollector) originally written to support the [Foodborne](http://foodborne.smartchicagoapps.org/) application. We are re-implementing it to support work around Open Health Inspection with the goal of exploring connections between food related tweets in Hampton Roads (or possibly all of Virginia) and health inspections.

## Setup

Fill out the credentials and parameters in the sample config/config.template and rename to config.js before executing.
